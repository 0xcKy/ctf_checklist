## Spray everything
- Find a new user? `ADD IT TO USERS.TXT`
- Find a new password? or something that *might* be a password? `ADD IT TO PASSWORDS.TXT`
- `SPRAY SPRAY SPRAY`
- FTP, SSH, CME, SMB, KERBEROS, ADMIN CONSOLES, ANYTHING THAT ACCEPTS CREDENTIALS JUST TRY IT

## Try default creds and dumb creds
- Find a software you've never heard of? `SEARCH FOR DEFAULT CREDENTIALS`
- Find a software you have heard of? `SEARCH FOR DEFAULT CREDENTIALS`
- Find a new user? `TRY THE USERNAME AS THE PASSWORD`  `user:user` `admin:admin`
- Can't crack a password? `TRY THE USERNAME AS THE PASSWORD`

## Try alternate cracking techniques
- Hashcat didn't work? Tried with rules? `TRY IT WITH JOHN, TRY IT WITH CRACKSTATION`
- John didn't work? `TRY IT WITH HASHCAT, TRY IT WITH CRACKSTATION`
- Crackstation didn't work? `TRY IT WITH HASHCAT, TRY IT WITH JOHN`
